# AutoHotKey DayZ Server Spammer
This AutoHotKey script will help spam your way into a DayZ server.

Every half a second it will center the mouse above the "OK" button then press Enter.

When the "Joining Game" screen pops up and vanishes or the server screen appears to stop responding - you are probably joining the server. 

# Directions:


* Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/)

* **Download Zip** and extract DayZpammer.ahk

* (Or: **Copy+Paste** *DayZpammer.ahk* into your favourite text editor then save as AnythingYouLike.ahk

* Right click DayZpammer.ahk 

* Click *Run Script*

DirectX does some strange things to capture input so the best way to always get it working is:

* Select the server you want to join in your favourites tab to highlight it red
* 
* (optionally: try to join first and wait for the "OK" dialogue)

* Alt+Tab out of DayZ or Shift+Tab into the Steam overlay

* Start spamming (Ctrl+1) then Tab back into DayZ.

**Ctrl+1** - Start Spamming

**Ctrl+2** - Stop Spamming (For when you think you're in!!!1!)

**Ctrl+3** - Terminate the script (For when you're done)

**Ctrl+4** - Terminate DayZ.exe (Useful if the game freezes)

*Happy Server Spamming!*



**Bonus Tips:**

Adjust the value assigned to **offset** to change the mouse position if it doesn't move to the "OK" button properly.

Remove the lines with **SoundBeep** to stop the beeping.
