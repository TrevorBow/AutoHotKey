# AutoHotKey DayZ Server Spammer
This AutoHotKey script will help spam your way into a DayZ server.

Every half a second it will center the mouse above the "OK" button then presses Enter.

# Directions:
Download Zip or copy/paste DayZpammer.ahk into WhatEverYouLike.ahk from your favourite text editor (e.g. Notepad or Notepad++)

Install AutoHotKey **>** Right Click the .ahk file **>** Click Run Script

DirectX does some strange things to capture input so the best way to always get it working is:

Select the server you want to join to highlight it red (optionally: try to join first and wait for the "OK" dialogue), Alt+Tab out of DayZ or Shift+Tab into the Steam overlay, Tab back into DayZ once you start the spamming.

**Ctrl+1** - Start Spamming

**Ctrl+2** - Stop Spamming

**Ctrl+3** - Terminate the script

**Ctrl+4** - Terminate DayZ.exe

*Happy Server Spamming!*



**Bonus Tips:**

Adjust the value assigned to **offset** to change the mouse position if it doesn't move to the "OK" button properly.

Remove the lines with **SoundBeep** to stop the beeping.
