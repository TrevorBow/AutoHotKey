# AutoHotKey DayZ Server Spammer
This AutoHotKey script will help spam your way into a DayZ server.

It centers the mouse above the "OK" button and presses Enter every half a second.

# Directions:
Install AutoHotKey **>** Save "DaySpam.ahk" as "WhatEverYouLike.ahk" **>** Right Click the .ahk file **>** Click Run Script

DirectX does some strange things to capture input so the best way to always get it working is:

Select the server you want to join to highlight it red, Alt+Tab out of DayZ or Shift+Tab into the Steam overlay, Tab back into DayZ once you start the spamming.

**Ctrl+1** - Start Spamming

**Ctrl+2** - Stop Spamming

**Ctrl+3** - Terminate the script

**Ctrl+4** - Terminate DayZ.exe

*Happy Server Spamming!*



**Bonus Tip:**

Adjust the value assigned to **offset** to change the mouse position if it doesn't move to the "OK" button properly.
