# AutoHotKey DayZ Server Spammer
This AutoHotKey script will help spam your way into a DayZ server.
It centers the mouse above the "OK" button and presses Enter every half a second.

# Directions:
Install AutoHotKey -> Save Print.ahk as WhatEverYouLike.ahk -> Right Click -> Run Script
DirectX does some strange things to capture input so the best way to always get it working is:
Try to enter a server, wait for the "OK" dialogue, Alt+Tab out of DayZ, Ctrl+1 then Alt+Tab back into DayZ.

Ctrl+1 - Start Spamming

Ctrl+2 - Stop Spamming

Ctrl+3 - Terminate the script

Ctrl+4 - Terminate DayZ.exe

Happy Server Spamming!
